<h1>Configuration Mode</h1>

<p>The diagnostic configuration menu allows for various operating parameters to be set.  The parameters can also be saved in non-volatile storage.</p>

<p>The diagnostic configuration menu displays the motor controller serial number as well as the firmware versions number and firmware inception date.</p>

</p>In diagnostic configuration mode the "Enter" key must be hit after each command input.</p>

<p>Primary Configuration Commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pressing "x" followed by "Enter" will exit diagnostic configuration mode and return to the diagnostic menu.</li>
  <li>Pressing "s" followed by "Enter" will save the current parameters in non-volatile memory.</li>
  <li>Pressing "f" followed by "Enter" will reset the all parameters to their hardcoded factory defaults.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Entering a number followed by "Enter" will prompt for a new setting for the configuration parameter.  If "Enter" is pressed before a new value has been entered the current value will remain.</p>
