<h1>Diagnostic / Test Mode</h1>

<p>Diagnostic mode is a simple ASCII terminal user interface that allows interaction with the motor controller electronics without requiring any additional topside software other than a serial terminal (such as <a href="http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/" target="_blank">Tera Term</a>).  The baud rate should be set to 115,200.</p>

<p>Test cables are available from VideoRay and use an FTDI RS-485 to USB serial adapter.  The driver for the adapter is a available from FTDI's website at: <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm</a>.

<script type="text/javascript">
document.write('<p style="background-color: ' + $_GET['diagnostic_mode'] + '">');
highlight('diagnostic_mode','');
</script>
To enter Diagnostic mode, input "+++++" (5 pluses) within 5 seconds after power up.  If 5 seconds have elapsed, or any <span class="folder">vrcsr</span> packets have been received, diagnostic mode will be locked out until the next power cycle.</p>

<p>Diagnostic mode includes <a href="../../m5_thruster/html/motor_activation_mode.html">Motor Activation Mode</a> and <a href="../../m5_thruster/html/configuration_mode.html">Configuration Mode</a>.  These modes are described on the following pages.</p>
