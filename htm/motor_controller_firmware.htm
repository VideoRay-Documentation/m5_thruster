<h1>Motor Controller Firmware</h1>

<p>On power up a serial bootloader is executed.  After one second, the bootloader will load and initiate the motor controller firmware.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> If "+++++" (5 plus signs) are entered within 5 seconds of power up, the device will enter diagnostic test mode where a simple ASCII user interface is implemented and a terminal can be used to control and configure the device.  See the <a href="../../m5_thruster/html/diagnostics_test_mode.html">Diagnostic Mode</a> section for more information.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The vr_refresh.exe application can be used to flash new firmware onto the controller.  See the <a href="../../m5_thruster/html/firmware_updates.html">Firmware Updates</a> section for more information.</p>

<h2>Communication Timeout</h2>

<p>The motor controller has a communication lost timeout of 1 second.  If the time since last <span class="folder">vr_csr packet</span> is >= 1 second the motor will set the power to 0.  Note that this does not occur in diagnostic mode.  Also note that the motor is NOT de-energized but remains active with the motor power set to 0.</p>

<h2>Fault Handling</h2>

<p>If a fault occurs, the thruster will de-energize and the fault must be cleared and the thruster re-initialized before it will actuate the motor.</p>
