<p>VideoRay is pleased to introduce the M5 series thruster motor.  This thruster features oil compensation for a 2,000 m (6,560 ft) depth rating, direct drive brushless motor with the motor controller built into the housing.  It delivers a high thrust to input power ratio and is very efficient at low inputs.  It has a low starting RPM, reverses instantly and does not cog.  It can be operated with either a left or a right pitch propeller.  Addressable firmware allows multiple thrusters to be connected to the same bus using a stackable plug.</p>
